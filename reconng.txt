• OSINT
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) reconnaissance involves using publicly available 
resources to passively gather information on a target (a person or organization). To best 
protect your organization, take the mindset of a threat actor.
• Passive OSINT
Passive Reconnaissance is one of the most important phases for successful hacking. Passive 
Reconnaissance uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to gather information 
about the target. To explain, we attempt to gather information about the target without 
interacting with it.
• Recon-ng
Recon-ng is a Web Reconnaissance tool written in Python. It has so many modules, database 
interaction, built-in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, 
Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open-source web-based reconnaissance 
can be conducted, and we can gather all information
Implementation:
A. Using Recon-ng tool
1. Open Kali Linux Virtual Machine. And Open terminal.
2. Type Recon-ng to enter the console.
3. Initially there are no modules installed. To install the modules,
a. Discovery module
